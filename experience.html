      <h2> This section will detail my work experience in the real world. </h2>
      <h4> I was fairly late compared to most on getting a job, but I always craved work since an early age. Whenever I was in middle school and high school, I always enjoyed voulenteering for concession work during basketball games to help the school, despite not even getting paid. Whenever I moved into college, I figured it would be high time to finally get a real job, and I have taken odd jobs every now and then between school. I first began as an employee at Andy's Frozen Custard (yes, I worked there for discounts), and that was my longest running job as it lasted me over my first summer. Aside from Andys and the occasional payed for yard work around my neighborhood, I also got some small time jobs working at the Alamo Drafthouse movie theater, and also working around dogs at the Howladay In dog training facility, mostly just cleaning messes and transporting dogs to various locations. </h4>
